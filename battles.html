            <p>Grendel, a monster who has been terrorizing the Danes at their great mead-hall Heorot, 
                is confronted and defeated by Beowulf, who fights Grendel bare-handed and eventually tears off one of Grendel's 
                arms which forced Grendel to retreat back to his lair. Grendel laid in his layer bleeding to death, but
                eventually, Beowulf finishes him off when he meets Grendel in his layer. Gruesome note: Beowulf hung Grendel's arm
                in Heorot and they held a party dancing and drinking as the arm just hung there.
